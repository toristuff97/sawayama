            RINA SAWAYAMA'S SECOND STUDIO ALBUM <br> <br> 
            The artist states in a press release that the album "is about family and identity. It's about understanding yourself in the context of two opposing cultures (for me British and Japanese), what "belonging" means when home is an evolving concept, figuring out where you sit comfortably within and awkwardly outside of stereotypes, and ultimately trying to be ok with just being you, warts and all." <br> <br>

<!-- Adding an in-depth bio for Rina Sawayama -->
        <div class="bio" id="bio"><h3>BIO</h3>
            <div class="bioText"> Born in Niigata, Japan, Rina chose to pursue music and modeling as a career after studying politics and sociology at Magdelene College, University of Cambridge. Her solo career began in 2013, with her single "Sleeping in Waking." In 2016, she released the single "Where U Are," with an accompanying music video co-directed by Alessandra Kurr. The single explored human interaction with digital media, with Sawayama explaining: "Online you can present your best edited self [and] your overheating phone substitutes human warmth. Weirdest of all—you're together, but also very alone." The song has been described as "nostalgic greatness... ultra-sweet and shimmering pop", and "90s R&B pop perfection". <br> In March 2017, her single "Cyber Stockholm Syndrome" premiered on The Fader. Sawayama described the genesis of the themes of the track as: "the digital world can offer vital support networks, voices of solidarity, refuge, escape. That's what 'Cyber Stockholm Syndrome' is about: pessimism, optimism, anxiety, and freedom." <br> In 2017, the singles "Alterlife" and "Tunnel Vision," a duet with Shamir, were released, followed by her debut mini-album Rina. Sawayama was then an unsigned artist, and Rina was released independently; she confirmed on Twitter that she worked for two to three years in order to save money to release the EP. The Guardian deemed the album "bracing and modern" and Sawayama as having proven she can shepherd pop into the future, too." Pitchfork ranked the album in its list of best pop and R&B albums of the year. In 2018, she released the single "Valentine" on Valentine's Day. The music video for album track "Ordinary Superstar" was released in June 2018. In August 2018, Sawayama released the track "Cherry", in which she explores her sexual identity. Sawayama embarked on her Ordinary Superstar tour across the UK and America in late 2018. <br> In 2019, she was the support act for Charli XCX's tour across the UK. <br> Her debut album/EP, Rina, was released in October of 2017. The self-titled album was ranked by Pitchfork as one of the best pop and R&B albums of the year. After releasing several other singles, she has returned with her second studio album, SAWAYAMA, available for purchase and streaming on all platforms.
